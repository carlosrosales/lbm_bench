This is derivative work based on the MP-LABS Open Source project:

https://github.com/carlosrosales/mplabs

I use this code personally as a test for may things: IO, hybrid execution,
scalability, etc... but I do not expect htis project to grow much. All 
development efforts will go into MP-LABS instead.
